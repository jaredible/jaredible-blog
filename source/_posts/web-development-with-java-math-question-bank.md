In this article, you will learn how to make a math question bank using Java EE and Apache Tomcat. The math question bank will provide an intuitive interface that can be used to store and display math questions.

I will be using the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers. We will be creating Servlets, JSPs, DAOs, and JavaBeans in this application.

We will begin by creating a new dynamic web project in Eclipse and then followed by creating the basic Servlet, JSP, DAO, and JavaBean files.

# Math Question Bank Example

This example java web application is made to be simple as possible so you can use this as a base framework and can be enhanced and edited according to your preferences.

# 1. New Dynamic Web Project
To demonstrate the Android examples in this lesson, we will make a [Maven](https://www.google.com) based project and start adding relevant examples.

For Kotlin support, we need to add a single dependency in *pom.xml* file:

```
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
    <artifactId>kotlin-stdlib</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.51</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
